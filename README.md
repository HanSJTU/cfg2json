# cfg2json
The source file is cfg2json.cpp, which can be compiled directly.
yolo.cfg is just for test, you can copy any file to the rootpath for converting if you want.

tips:
1.modify the filename in cfg2json.cpp before you compile the .cpp if you want to change the .cfg file.
2.The output.json is the result of the converting operation.
